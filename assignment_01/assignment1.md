## Assignment 1: What Is Intelligence?
**Exploring the Nature of AI, Mind, and Machine**

**Duration:** 1.5 hour  
**Format:** Group research, reflection, and presentation  
**Group Size:** 2 students per group (5 groups total)

### Overview
Before we dive into algorithms and code, we need to wrestle with a fundamental question: What is intelligence? This assignment asks you to explore this question from multiple angles—philosophical, biological, computational, and beyond. You'll research, reflect, and present your findings to spark a class-wide discussion.

### Group 1: The Materialist Perspective — "Is It All Just Atoms?"
**Central Question:** If the brain is just atoms following physical laws, what makes it "intelligent"? Could any sufficiently complex arrangement of matter become intelligent?

**Guiding Questions:**
- What is physicalism/materialism in philosophy of mind?
- If intelligence emerges from atoms interacting, what distinguishes a brain from a rock?
- Does complexity alone create intelligence, or is something else required?
- Could a computer made of different materials (silicon vs. carbon) be truly intelligent?

**Reflection Prompt:** Do you find it satisfying or troubling to think of your own mind as "just" atoms? Why?

### Group 2: The Turing Test — "If It Acts Intelligent, Is It?"
**Central Question:** Alan Turing proposed that if a machine can convincingly imitate human conversation, we should consider it intelligent. Is behavior enough to define intelligence?

**Guiding Questions:**
- What is the Turing Test and what was Turing trying to demonstrate?
- What are the main criticisms of the Turing Test (e.g., Searle's Chinese Room)?
- Have any systems "passed" the Turing Test? Does that matter?
- Is fooling humans the same as being intelligent?

**Reflection Prompt:** If you couldn't tell whether you were talking to a human or an AI, would that change how you think about the AI's "mind"?

### Group 3: Biological Intelligence — "What Can Nature Teach Us?"
**Central Question:** Intelligence exists in many forms in nature—from octopuses to slime molds to human brains. What do these diverse systems share, and what makes each unique?

**Guiding Questions:**
- How do different animals demonstrate intelligence (problem-solving, tool use, social learning)?
- Is human intelligence fundamentally different from animal intelligence, or just more complex?
- Can organisms without brains (plants, fungi, single cells) be considered intelligent?
- What does evolution suggest about the "purpose" of intelligence?

**Reflection Prompt:** Does learning about intelligence in other species change your view of what AI could or should be?

### Group 4: Alternative Intelligences — "Could There Be Minds We Can't Recognize?"
**Central Question:** Our concept of intelligence is shaped by human experience. Could there be forms of intelligence so different from ours that we wouldn't recognize them?

**Guiding Questions:**
- What is "anthropocentrism" in discussions of intelligence?
- How might an alien intelligence or a radically different AI think in ways we can't comprehend?
- Could collective systems (ant colonies, the internet, corporations) be considered intelligent?
- What are the limits of defining intelligence based on human criteria?

**Reflection Prompt:** If we encountered a truly alien intelligence, how would we know? What would convince you?

### Group 5: Intelligence vs. Consciousness — "Does Understanding Require Experience?"
**Central Question:** Is there a difference between processing information intelligently and actually understanding or experiencing something? Can AI be intelligent without being conscious?

**Guiding Questions:**
- What is the distinction between intelligence and consciousness?
- What is the "hard problem of consciousness"?
- Could a system be highly intelligent but have no inner experience (a "philosophical zombie")?
- Does it matter ethically whether AI systems have experiences?

**Reflection Prompt:** When you use an AI system, do you ever catch yourself wondering if "anyone is home"? What prompts that feeling?

### Presentation Requirements
Your 5-minute presentation should include:

1. **Brief overview of your perspective** (1 min)
2. **Key insights from your research** (2 min)
3. **Your group's reflection** — What do you think? Where do you agree or disagree with what you found? (1.5 min)
4. **One question to pose to the class for discussion** (0.5 min)

You may use slides, whiteboard, or simply speak—whatever helps you communicate effectively.
